            Review this pull request for the Dekaf Kafka client library (.NET).

            Use the following commands to gather information:
            - `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json title,body,files,commits` to get PR details
            - `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see the changes
            - `gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews` to see existing reviews
            - Read the CLAUDE.md file for project-specific requirements

            REVIEW FOCUS:
            1. CLAUDE.md compliance (zero-allocation in hot paths, ConfigureAwait(false), comprehensive testing)
            2. Thread-safety issues
            3. Resource leaks (IDisposable not disposed)
            4. Security concerns
            5. Code quality and best practices

            IMPORTANT FOR SUBSEQUENT PUSHES:
            - If there are existing reviews, check if previous issues have been addressed
            - Only report NEW issues or issues that remain unfixed
            - Acknowledge fixed issues briefly

            After reviewing, post a PR review using:
            `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "YOUR_REVIEW"`

            Or if approving:
            `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "YOUR_REVIEW"`
